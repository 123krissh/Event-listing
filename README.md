<h1>Event Listing Web Application </h1>

<p>This project is a dynamic event listing web application that scrapes events from an external website [https://www.eventbrite.com.au/] and displays them in a user-friendly interface. Users can view list of events detail and get redirected to the original event page after submitting their email. This system was designed to be visually appealing, responsive across devices, and automatically updated as new events appear on the source website.</p>
